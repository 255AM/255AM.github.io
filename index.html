        <div class="item item2"><p> I’m a former Marine living in Louisville, Kentucky after stints in Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina.<br><br>
                Growing up in Virginia, I spent many a night in bed, staring at posters of Atari 2600 games, and imagining how great they must be.<br><br>
                Atari was my first foray into coding; after my dad brought home a used Atari 800XL, I spent hours copying lines of code out of a guide. All that work—just to make the screen flash a few times!<br><br>
                Since then, I’ve worked as a construction worker, an HVAC contractor, an aircraft firefighter, a credit fraud investigator, an arcade machine mechanic, a private detective, a blackbox tester and a technical editor.<br><br>
                I’ve been to Mexico, Spain, Italy, Thailand, Greece, Japan, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Kosovo, Andorra, Malta and France.<br><br>
                I convinced a good woman to marry me, and helped create two amazing boys.<br><br>
                I still get that same feeling I got, years ago, coding that ancient Atari.</p></div>
